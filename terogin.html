                <h2>Terogin's Backstory</h2>
                <p>Terogin is a Leonin whos home town was ransacked in an attempt to erase all traces of Leonins from the world. A group of corrupt monks from a large, government funded, dynasty were tasked to track down all small camps that remained of the endangered loin humanoid race. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A smaller, more modest and humble collection of far more powerful and spiritually in-tuned monks saw all of the destruction and raced to help. They were met at the bottom of their mountains with a slaughtering of innocent leonins. This would enrage the monks and force them to attempt salvation and stop the money hungry frauds. With powerful ki strikes they were able to incapacitate most of the wrong doers and force them to retreat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All that seemed to be living was a young lion cub still inside of a burning tent. He was rescued and brought up to the monks small and cozy training quarters. This is where his life long training began. But, as a trial, the founders of the Dynasty had told Terogin that if he could not fix his lion mannerisms and  and unreasonable apatite, hed never make it as a monk. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His fate was set, he was told to come back when he learned to get rid of his "issues" and has undergone his own training to learn to be calm no matter the situation. He isnt perfect, but that is the end goal of any monk in training.</p>

                <h2>Please note</h2>
                <p>Terogin is a gentle giant. He is the last of his kind and as such is more familliar with humans than lions. He is also able to walk on both two and four legs, but shows a preference for walking on fours.</p>
