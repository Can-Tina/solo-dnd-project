                <h2>Clarisse's Backstory</h2>
                <p>When the Royal family of Lullin were discovered to be changelings, Clarisse had no choice but to flee. With a citywide witch hunt calling for blood, decisions had to be made quickly. She stole some peasant clothes and joined the riot for weeks until it died down. To keep a low profile, the bare ground became her mattress. Finally, the guards standing by the city gate started letting people in and out again, and she made her final escape. She had no clue if her parents and teenage brother were safe but it was unlikely she would ever see them again anyway.
<br>
<br>
                    The day she left her hometown was the day she decided that life was too short. Her blonde hair became black and green. Her dresses became armour. The book at her hip became a sword. The only thing that stayed the same for her was her rose-gold crown that brushed her eyebrows, reminding her of what once was and what she planned to take back.
