                <h2>Francis' Backstory</h2>
                <p>Francis is a small and angry man who has spent his life living in a small hut in the forest. Almost everything he has, he’s made for himself (including said hut). He’s incredibly handy and has the ability to talk to animals and has a love/hate relationship with a squirrel named fred, who he regularly berates. 
                    His main goal in life is to be left to his own devices as he finds a kind of peace in the quiet, humble life he lives. He’s not quick to open up as it’s not ended well for him in the past and he will yell at you if you say he isn’t fine with that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>He’s in the city to attend the slum market, where he occasionally goes to buy things he cannot find in the forest</p>

                <h2>Please note</h2>
                <p>While Clarisse referrs to Francis as her kid, due to her buying him when they first met, Francis is over 25 years older than Clarisse and hates being called a child. It would be wise to not piss him off as he's known to make great final attacks with his great-axe.</p>
