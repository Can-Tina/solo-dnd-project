                    <h2>15/10/2021 - A new beginning</h2>
                    <p>Clarisse, Daemon, Francis and Terogin met in Phlan's town square.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At first, all four were spread out. Lost amongst the crowd. Clarisse made one of her typical scenes, shouting, demanding to know what was going on and that kicked off our session. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When a merchant's cart is raided, Terogin's heroic side showed up immediately as he dramatically scared away the scavengers in his big cat way before stalking off to find the poor retreated merchant. Daemon decided to accompany the merchant and Terogin in the tavern.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Meanwhile, Francis found himself in a spot of trouble when he went over to investigate the now abandoned cart. A pair of ruffians decided to make a quick penny, picking Francis up by the back of his wife beater. Eagle-eyed Clarisse decided she wanted a new playmate, and sensing the intentions of said ruffians, she pounced. One trick later, Francis, now dubbed Pete, was her son.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Francis and Clarisse made their way over to the tavern too, after spotting a lion with thumbs chilling in the doorway. They were greeted by a rather flustered and annoyed merchant who gave them their quest.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As per the merchants instructions, the party made their way to a prison housing an ex cult member. They quickly bribed the halfling prison guard with the 500 gold the merchant gave them, much to the dismay of Francis, and made their way inside. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before they could even lay down a plan to break their contact out of prison, alarms started blaring. Terogin bit the chains binding Rath, somehow not hurting his teeth, and the party dashed out of the cell into a corridor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It wasn't long before they discovered the reason for the alarms. There was a minotaur on the loose.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After far too many failed and weak hits, drawing the minotaur from one person to another like a bullfighting ring, Francis laid an incredible killing blow with his great-axe.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And this is where we leave our heroes for now.
